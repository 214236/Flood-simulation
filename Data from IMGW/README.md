This Python script allows you to download and process daily hydrological observation data from the Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW-PIB). It connects to the official public FTP server, downloads monthly ZIP archives containing CSV files, extracts and parses them using pandas, and merges the data into a single CSV file for further analysis. The script supports flexible configuration of the year range (between 1951 and 2022) by setting YEAR_START and YEAR_END variables. It automatically handles different character encodings (utf-8, cp1250, iso-8859-2) and skips corrupted or incompatible files while logging any issues. The resulting CSV file is saved in a downloads/ directory placed in the same folder as the script, with the filename indicating the selected year range (e.g., dobowe_from_2008_to_2012.csv). The script assumes that the files are small enough to be handled in RAM. It requires Python 3.7 or later, along with the pandas and requests libraries, which can be installed via pip install pandas requests. This tool is especially useful for researchers, students, or developers who need historical hydrological data from Polish measurement stations for analysis or modeling purposes. All data is sourced directly from IMGW-PIBâ€™s public archive: https://danepubliczne.imgw.pl/.
